# Dataset-Mach-Stem-Heights

This public repository contains the dataset of the Mach Stem Heights of Irregular Reflections in steady flows in the weak shock domain. The mach stem height varies with respect to the corresponding geometric and flow conditions. The columns 'w/H' and 'Mach' are in non-dimensional units. The column 'theta' is provided in degrees and the mach stem heights are in millimetric units.
